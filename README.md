# Day 1 – Introduction to Python Fundamentals

Today I learned the basic concepts of Python programming and understood how Python works.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Programming Paradigms

* Procedural Programming

  * Step-by-step execution.
  * Code is organized into functions or procedures.
  * Example: C language.

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

  * Based on objects and classes.
  * Helps organize and manage code efficiently.

### 2. Objects and Memory Management

* Used `id()` function to understand memory locations.
* Learned that objects are created and stored in memory.
* Used `type()` to identify data types.

### 3. Features of Python

* Dynamically Typed Language.
* Interpreted Language.
* High-Level Language.
* Cross-platform support.
* Large library ecosystem.

### 4. Python History

* Python was created by Guido van Rossum.
* First released in 1991.

### 5. Tokens in Python

* Keywords
* Identifiers
* Literals
* Operators
* Punctuators

### 6. Variables and Naming Rules

* Valid and invalid variable names.
* Rules for creating variables.

### 7. Comments

* Single-line comments (`#`)
* Multi-line comments (`''' '''` and `""" """`)

### 8. Boolean Values

* Understanding True and False.
* Comparison operators.

## Conclusion

Day 1 focused on understanding Python fundamentals, programming concepts, variables, tokens, comments, and basic data types.

# Day 2 – Python Operators

Today I learned different types of operators in Python and how they are used in real-world programming.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Floor Division (//)
* Modulus (%)
* Exponent (**)

### 2. Assignment Operators

* =
* +=
* -=
* *=
* %=
* //=

These operators help update variable values efficiently.

### 3. Comparison Operators

* ==
* !=
* >
* <
* > =
* <=

Used for comparing values and making decisions in programs.

### 4. Logical Operators

* and
* or
* not

Used to combine multiple conditions.

### 5. Identity Operators

* is
* is not

Learned the difference between:

* `==` → compares values.
* `is` → compares memory locations (objects).

### 6. Membership Operators

* in
* not in

Used to check whether a value exists inside a sequence such as a list.

### 7. Bitwise Operators

* &
* |
* ^
* ~
* <<
* > >

Learned how binary operations work and how left shift and right shift operators perform multiplication and division operations.

## Key Learnings

* Operators are essential for calculations and decision-making.
* Identity operators compare objects rather than values.
* Bitwise operators work directly with binary numbers.
* Logical operators help create complex conditions.

# Day 3 – Python Data Types and String Operations

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Data Types in Python

Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a variable.

#### Numeric Data Types

* Integer (`int`)
* Float (`float`)

Example:

```python
num = 8
num_2 = 7.89
```

### 2. Floor Division (`//`)

The floor division operator returns the quotient as the nearest whole number.

Example:

```python
num = 6.89
print(num // 2)
```

### 3. Strings in Python

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (`' '`) or double quotes (`" "`).

Features:

* Strings are immutable (cannot be modified directly).
* Strings support concatenation using the `+` operator.

Example:

```python
so = "Python"
any_ = " is a Language"
print(so + any_)
```

### 4. String Indexing

Indexing allows us to access individual characters in a string.

* Positive indexing starts from `0`.
* Negative indexing starts from `-1`.

Example:

```python
so = "Python is a Language"
print(so[3])
print(so[-1])
```

### 5. String Methods

#### replace()

Replaces old text with new text.

```python
so.replace("python", "Java")
```

#### join()

Joins characters or strings using a separator.

```python
"-".join(so)
```

#### split()

Splits a string into a list.

```python
so.split()
```

#### count()

Counts the occurrences of a substring.

```python
so.count("a")
```

### 6. Built-in String Functions

* `len()` – Returns the length of the string.
* `max()` – Returns the maximum character.
* `min()` – Returns the minimum character.

Example:

```python
len(so)
max(so)
min(so)
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Understanding data types and string operations is essential because strings play a major role in data cleaning, text processing, and real-world data analysis tasks. Learning string methods and built-in functions helps write efficient and readable Python code.
